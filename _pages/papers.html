<h3><ax href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.488..559Z/abstract>ASKAP detection of periodic and elliptically polarized radio pulses from UV Ceti</a></h3>
  <p>Here, we present the discovery of periodic (P~5.5hr) radio pulses from the prototypical flare star, UV Ceti. This is the first observation of planet-like auroral activity on an active mid-M dwarf. Unexpectedly, some of the pulsed emission exhibited linear polarisation, which we suggest indicates emission arising from an extreme under-density in the stellar atmosphere.
