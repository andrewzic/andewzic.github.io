  I am a Research Scientist at Space & Astronomy, CSIRO. My research involves using pulsar signals to search for gravitational waves and for societal applications. I also use radio telescopes to investigate dynamic behaviour of galactic radio sources, including active stars, pulsars, and unknowns. I am a member of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array collaboration, who I represent on the International Pulsar Timing Array Steering Committee.
