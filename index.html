  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Space & Astronomy, CSIRO. My research involves using pulsar signals to search for gravitational waves and for societal applications. I also use cutting-edge radio telescopes to search for and characterise dynamic objects like flare stars and other objects throughout the Milky Way.
