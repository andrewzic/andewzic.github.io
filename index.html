<p>
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Research Centre for Astronomy, Astrophysics and Astrophotonics (MQAAAstro), Macquarie University and Space & Astronomy, CSIRO. I research pulsars, radio emission of cool stars, scintillation, and other variable radio sources. I am currently examining the effect of solar system ephemeris errors and other noise sources on precision pulsar timing experiments.

  I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney and CSIRO Astronomy & Space Science in 2020, on "Cool Stellar Activity at Low Radio Frequencies".
