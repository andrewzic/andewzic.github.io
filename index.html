<p>
  I am a PhD candidate at The University of Sydney and CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, supervised by Tara Murphy, Christene Lynch, and George Heald. I use telescopes such as the Australian SKA Pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to study the activity of low-mass stars.

Apart from research, I also enjoy engaging in education and outreach. I am currently an Astronomy Guide at Sydney Observatory, and have tutored and developed a variety of undergraduate courses at The University of Sydney.

When I am not doing work, I enjoy bushwalking, cooking, and watching the Sydney Swans win.
