<p>
  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Macquarie University Astronomy, Astrophysics and Astrophotonics (MQAAAstro) and CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science (CASS). I research pulsars, radio emission of cool stars, scinitillation, and other variable radio sources. I am currently examining the effect of errors in the solar system barycentre on precision pulsar timing experiments.

  I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney and CASS in 2020, on "Cool Stellar Activity at Low Radio Frequencies".
