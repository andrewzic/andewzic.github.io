  I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow based at CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science and Macquarie University Astronomy, Astrophysics and Astrophotonics (MQAAAstro). My research interests range from studies of radio transients, multiwavelength and radio studies of stellar activity, scintillation, and pulsars. I am currently focused on improving measurements of the solar system barycentre for precision pulsar timing with the PPTA.

  I completed my PhD at The University of Sydney and CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, supervised by Tara Murphy, Christene Lynch, and George Heald. My research focused on low-frequency studies of stellar activity, using facilities such as the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, the Murchison Widefield Array, and the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Using these facilities, I probed the magnetospheric properties of ultra-cool dwarfs, confirmed the presence of aurorae on a main-sequence M-dwarf for the first time, and made the most compelling detection of a solar-type radio burst from another star to date, indicating a coronal mass ejection from Proxima Centauri

  Outside of my research, I enjoy cooking, bushwalking, and the footy.
