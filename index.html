<p>
  I am a PhD candidate at The University of Sydney and CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, supervised by Tara Murphy, Christene Lynch, and George Heald. I use telescopes such as the Australian SKA Pathfinder, the Murchison Widefield Array, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to study bursty and steady emission from these active low-mass stars, and the insights this gives into their magnetospheres.

Highlights of my research include the discovery of auroral radio emission arising from extreme cavities in the magnetosphere of UV Ceti, and using the spectral turnover of quiescent ultra-cool dwarf emission to constrain their global coronal properties.

<p>
Other research interests include methods of detecting pulsars in radio continuum images  an area I focused on for my Honours thesis and undergraduate research, working with Tara Murphy, Christene Lynch, Emil Lenc, and David Kaplan.

I have also actively engaged in education and outreach in a variety of roles, including as an Astronomy Guide at Sydney Observatory, CAASTRO Uluru Astronomer in Residence, undergraduate Physics and Astronomy Tutor at The University of Sydney, and lead tutor for "QBUS3820: Machine Learning and Data Science in Business" at The University of Sydney.

When I am not doing work, I enjoy bushwalking, cooking, and watching the Sydney Swans win.
