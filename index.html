  I am a PhD candidate at The University of Sydney and CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, supervised by Tara Murphy, Christene Lynch, and George Heald. My research focuses on low-frequency radio emission of active stars. I use instruments such as ASKAP, the GMRT, and the MWA to study bursty and steady emission from these objects, and the insights this gives into the physical processes in their magnetospheres. Highlights of my research include the discovery of auroral radio emission arising from extreme cavities in the magnetosphere of UV Ceti, and using the spectral turnover of quiescent ultra-cool dwarf emission to constrain their global coronal properties.
